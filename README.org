+TITLE: Eae -- Emacs Awesome Edition

*Eae* also means "Hey" in portuguese, and is a common greeting in Brazil, just 
as this config is a greeting for those coming to Emacs.
This is my personal config based on several materials that i've encountered 
and applied. After writing several similar "dotemacs", in this take I'll apply
concepts and to make this set of customization reproduceble and easy to read,
being some of those concepts:

- Use of Layers instead of modules
- Config in .el instead of parsing .org
- base structure directory named `core/' instead of `lisp/'
- Avoid use of CLIs or scripts by making instead use of
  Emacs powerful customization system
- Custom keymap system powered by `evil.el', inspired by 
  Xah Lee's `xah-fly-keys.el'


Naming convention:

  `eae/NAME` : Interactive custom functions
  `+NAME`    : Library to be used as helper functions. Like `dash.el'
      (e.g. +split-window-right, +quietly to execute specific actions with no echo)
  `NAME!`    : Macros that often are a more complete version from Emacs stdlib
      (e.g. `after!' instead of `with-eval-load-after')
