;;; custom.el --- Custom variables and Emacs "don't ask me again" things

;;; Commentary: To turn this file more useful I wil also append
;;; some custom variables to make use in my entire file.

 ;; custom-set-variables was added by Custom.
 ;; If you edit it by hand, you could mess it up, so be careful.
 ;; Your init file should contain only one such instance.
 ;; If there is more than one, they won't work right.

 ;; custom-set-faces was added by Custom.
 ;; If you edit it by hand, you could mess it up, so be careful.
 ;; Your init file should contain only one such instance.
